# Disinfection Theme — Installation Guide

This project uses **ACF** and **Pods** for WordPress to manage custom post types and fields.

## Installation

1. Unzip the `disinfection-theme.zip` archive and upload the folder to `/wp-content/themes/`.
2. In the admin panel go to **Appearance → Themes** and activate the **"Disinfection"** theme.
3. Go to **Tools → Import → WordPress** and upload the `export-wordpress.xml` file  
   (install the importer if prompted).
4. All tabs and pests will appear in **Pods → Pest Tabs** and **Pods → Pests**.
5. Button links can be edited directly inside each pest card.

Everything is fully dynamic. You can add new tabs and services without a developer.
